# __P2g__

_Welcome to P2g - the api which aims to provide a light-touch upon the world of lifestyle. Instead of the conventional multi-medial content, P2g seeks to establish more of a conservative platform where users are given simple tools and digital space for:_
* ___depicting their life paradigm through the lens of diary-like entries;___
* ___a unique presentation of ideas, facilitating delivery of an individual's tastes and preferences - where liking is not a matter of a numeric increment - but the act of carefully tought-through process, via P2g platform bringing resonance to people's creative endeavours;
* ___establishing a meet-up-point for  those individuals willing to develop thier writing skills by getting a genuine feedback through impressions of those users attending their feeds;___

>>>User story: "I wish to access a closed community-based platform which can provide me with a registration and data protection. As a I user, I wish to have the ability to share my life's interests with others who might be in a search of an authentic lifestyle. I further seek to get an easy navigation across needs of: making updates to my profile and posts, following up the community around my feeds and have an access to other users' feeds."

## MVP
* CRUD for the User,
* a model as further presented in ERD,
* basic styling (including every button stylised),
* working routes

### Technologies
Django -> Framework 
<br>
psql-> database
<br>
REACT.js / python -> building blocks

### Models
1. There are two models built in the back-end models.py; the User is pre-built in Django framework, which favourably demonstrates its potency and usability advantages.
2. The two models are: 'Comments' and 'Interest'; the relation between an interest is one-to-many (i.e. one interest owns many comments).

### Routes
Routes were conceptualised to be linked as follows:

#### WWW (still some satisfaction stands)
1. Building up the back-end <br>
 a) Creating functionality and testing them in the back-end; <br>
 b) Eagerness in coding more of python;
2. Front-end understanding of principles and steps necessary for setting up a React front-end;

#### EBI (so stretchy - surely snaps )
1. Somewhat, fix the routes and general naming conventions;
2. Work on setting up an appropriate model for building up a community of users;
3. Functionality of front-end 'Pages' directory;
4. Design to the outlay of components/pages/buttons;
5. Not starting a code that would not be finished - i.e. depend more on AI than of somebody's help.

>__Final Note:__ <br>
A good reflection point upon quality of production process and of final product shall be best assessed in the deployed version. Henceforth, in the absence of a deployed web version, I pull everything down in the conclusion that the learning process is one prime product of this experience. Further summing it into the moral of: __DO IT YOURSELF!__
